# 🌸 Learn HTML Fundamental

Hi! I'm Raffida 👋  
This repo is my learning space to understand **basic HTML structure and tags** no CSS, no JavaScript, just pure HTML vibes 💻✨  

## 🎯 Goal
To master the **fundamental building blocks** of a web page:  
- Headings `<h1>–<h6>`  
- Paragraphs `<p>`  
- Lists `<ul>` & `<ol>`  
- Tables `<table>`  
- Links `<a>` and Images `<img>`  
- Layout using `<div>`  

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How HTML tags work together to build page structure  
- The difference between inline & block elements  
- How to create simple layouts and tables  
- How to write clean, readable HTML code
